This report serves as a comprehensive summary of my internship focused on Network Operations and ISP Support, conducted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the B.Sc. CSIT (8th Semester) program under Tribhuvan University. The primary goal of this internship was to bridge the gap between classroom-based theoretical knowledge and the practical complexities of a real-world Internet Service Provider environment. During this period, I gained hands-on experience in how an ISP integrates diverse equipment and telecommunication lines to establish a reliable point-of-presence for its geographic area. My work involved understanding the mechanics of high-speed leased lines, maintaining service uptime, and assisting in the deployment of essential internet-related services. By engaging directly with network infrastructure and troubleshooting protocols, I developed a deeper understanding of how ISPs manage large-scale connectivity and dependency on telecommunication providers. Overall, this internship proved to be a highly satisfactory learning experience, providing me with the technical proficiency and practical insights necessary to help make modern life more convenient through reliable internet access.
