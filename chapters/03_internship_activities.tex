\section{Roles and Responsibilities}

During the ten-week internship period at the Network Operations Center (NOC), several key roles and responsibilities were undertaken to ensure network stability and customer satisfaction.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network Monitoring:} Continuous monitoring of network health was performed using the Zabbix platform. This included observing uptime, latency, and packet loss for distribution switches in the Kathmandu Valley area.

    \item \textbf{Customer Support and CRM Management:} Responsibilities included handling the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to log trouble tickets. Technical issues were categorized into slow internet, loss of signal (LOS), or billing issues, and complex cases were escalated to Level-2 engineers.

    \item \textbf{Device Configuration:} Basic configuration of Layer-2 switches was carried out, including the creation of VLANs such as VLAN~10 for data traffic and VLAN~20 for voice traffic, along with port assignments using command-line interfaces.

    \item \textbf{Fiber Diagnostics:} Fiber to the Home (FTTH) issues were diagnosed by analyzing optical power levels (Rx/Tx) and identifying customers experiencing high signal attenuation below $-27$~dBm.

    \item \textbf{System Administration:} Basic Linux server administration tasks were conducted, including accessing servers via SSH and analyzing system logs to support troubleshooting processes.

    \item \textbf{Network Security Implementation:} Network security tasks included configuring Access Control Lists (ACLs) on routers and monitoring DDoS mitigation systems to safeguard core network infrastructure.
