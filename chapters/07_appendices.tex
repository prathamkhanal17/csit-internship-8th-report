\section{Network Topology Overview}

Figure A.1 illustrates the high-level network topology of Subisu Cablent operations in the Chitwan region. The diagram shows the interconnection between backbone network links, metropolitan area network infrastructure, and last-mile connections to customer premises. The topology includes redundancy configurations designed to ensure service availability in case of equipment failures.

\section{Core Network Architecture}

The core network consists of multiple high-capacity routers connected in a mesh configuration providing redundancy and load balancing. Backbone links utilize fiber optic connections with capacity in the range of multiple gigabits per second. The core network provides connectivity to regional distribution points and serves as the aggregation point for all customer traffic.

\section{Distribution Network Architecture}

Distribution nodes connect the core network to the last-mile infrastructure serving customers. These nodes perform traffic aggregation and apply quality of service policies to prioritize critical applications. Distribution network equipment includes layer 3 switches and routers configured with virtual private network capabilities to support enterprise customers.

\chapter{Monitoring Tool Screenshots}

\section{Network Monitoring Dashboard}

Figure B.1 displays the main network monitoring dashboard developed during the internship. The dashboard provides real-time visualization of bandwidth utilization, latency metrics, and connection status across monitored network segments. Color-coded indicators enable quick assessment of network health.

\section{Bandwidth Analysis Interface}

Figure B.2 shows the bandwidth analysis interface displaying historical usage patterns. The interface enables filtering by time period, network segment, and customer segment. Interactive charts allow identification of peak usage periods and unusual consumption patterns.

\section{Alert Configuration Screen}

Figure B.3 presents the alert configuration interface where thresholds for automated notifications are defined. Users can configure different alert levels for various metrics and specify notification delivery methods including email, SMS, and dashboard notifications.
