    \chapter{Screenshots}
The following visual documentation serves as a definitive record of the terminal-based interactions and command-line execution sequences performed during the infrastructure configuration phase. These captures substantiate the systematic implementation of logical network segmentation, illustrating the precise methodology used to initialize Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) and the subsequent orchestration of physical port assignments via the PuTTY management interface. This section provides a transparent view of the administrative protocols utilized to ensure optimal traffic isolation and network integrity.

This appendix presents the chronological record of activities undertaken
during the ten-week internship period at the Subisu Cablenet Ltd. These
weekly logs detail the day-to-day responsibilities, technical tasks, and
troubleshooting procedures. They serve as an official verification of
attendance and provide a granular view of the progression from theoretical
orientation to hands-on network configuration and system administration.
